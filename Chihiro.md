# Sega Chihiro

The Sega Chihiro is an arcade system based off of the original Microsoft Xbox.

## Types

The Sega Chihiro comes in 2 types. The Type 1 and the Type 3. The Type 3 can play most games, and the type one can not play very many at all. The type one however can play The House Of The Dead 3 and Crazy Taxi : High Roller that the Type 3 cannot officially play. However if you are Netbooting there are versions of the games that will work properly, although I haven't managed to get Crazy Taxi to run properly yet.

## Net Booting

A type 3 chihiro (and triforce, seeing as they have the same media board) requires a zero key to netboot. It cannot use the hack in triforce tools.

### The House Of The Dead 3

Change: 5842414D C0010000 D2070909 07000000
to: 5842414D C0010000 D2070909 07000100

To make it boot on Type 3, for Type 1 go the other way.

## Media Board

The Media Board in the Type 3 Chihiro is 100% the same as the Media Board in the Type 3 TriForce.

## Link Play

Link play is done through the same Ethernet port that is used for Netbooting. Link play will change the IP address used.
