# Sega Chihiro

The Sega Chihiro is an arcade system based off of the original Microsoft Xbox.

# Types

The Sega Chihiro comes in 2 types. The Type 1 and the Type 3. The Type 3 can play most games, and the type one can not play very many at all. The type one however can play The House Of The Dead 3 and one other than the Type 3 cannot officially play. However if you are Netbooting there are versions of the games that will work properly.

# Media Board

The Media Board in the Type 3 Chihiro is 100% the same as the Media Board in the Type 3 TriForce.
