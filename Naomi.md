# Sega Naomi

The Sega Naomi is an arcade platform based on the Sega Dreamcast.

## Netbooting

Netbooting is done via a Net Dimm and requires a specific bios version to run.

## Carts

The House Of The Dead 2 will only run from a special cart. It originally came in a Naomi with a metal box. It uses an older version of the bios.

## GD-ROM

## JVS

The Sega Naomi uses the JVS protocol. Interestingly the Sync pin is not required to operate properly for the Naomi to work. The Sync pin can simply be connected to ground and the Naomi will operate with one JVS node.
